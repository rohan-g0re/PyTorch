# Introduction

As the original paper of GANs and DCGAN does not provide a concrete architecture for generator and discriminator, and are only limited to concrete training framework and suggestions about network architecture, I have decided to use a simple CNN motivated architecture which involves convolution and deconvolutions layers.

**I will be refering to this [article by Jason Brownle](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-an-mnist-handwritten-digits-from-scratch-in-keras/).**

**The only difference is that the article uses keras whereas I will be builidng the GAN using PyTorch.**
